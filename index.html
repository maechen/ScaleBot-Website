        <p id="proposaltxt">ScaleBot will be a computer software system that will return a percent accuracy based on pitch/intonation of a musical scale (do-re-mi...) performance for string instruments (violin, viola, cello, and bass). My anticipated research will focus on algorithms and data structures, system development, physics of sound, and music theory. I will learn how to analyze and describe sound data, how to code with Python, and how musical scales work (what key signature determines where whole and half steps are). Throughout this process, I will also learn to use Ubuntu, PyCharm V3, and Python Sound Processing Libraries for coding in python. I will obtain the data by collecting orchestra submissions through sharing voice memo files with Google Drive (from orchestra friends and myself). By the end of the year, I should have a finished, working system that I can demonstrate for my presentation. I would like to have one of my orchestra friends play live and upload a scale and reveal if the system score is approved by my orchestra teacher.</p>
